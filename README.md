# ukbbl_admin_scripts

Admin scripts for easing processing of UKBBL.

## Requirements

This script is run using python in jupyterlabs. To install the required python packages use anaconda, and install using the included `environment.yml` file:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
This will create a conda environment called `google_sheets`, which you can activate and run jupyterlab from:
```
conda activate google_sheets
jupyter-lab
```
